          <li>Making Games (mostly my personal projects)</li>

        <h4>Current Personal Projects:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h4>MTG Multiplayer</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Way to play magic with another person without needing to own the cards you use</li>
              <li>Has working multiplayer locally and non locally</li>
              <li><a href="https://scryfall.com/" target="_blank">Scryfall</a> used as the database for card data and images (using its <a href="https://scryfall.com/docs/api" target="_blank">REST API</a>)</li>
              <li>Deck files are very small files that only store data and image urls</li>
              <li>You can test your decks by playing with yourself by running multiple instances of the game</li>
              <li>Can be viewed <a href="https://phyrexian-agent.itch.io/mtg-game" target="_blank">here</a> using password "Yawgmoth" with how to use game on the page itself and with some basic decks to test it</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Cult Hunter (likely not final name)</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>A game about the player figuring out cult members from a small town</li>
              <li>Player is to try to blend in and not get noticed by imbedded cult</li>
              <li>Cult will react and become more aware of the player over time</li>
              <li>Cult will do actions such as intimidation, murder, public speticles, terrorism and such</li>
              <li>Town the player goes to will be procedurally generated along with its inhabitants</li>
              <li>Player can customize their appearence from the same assets used to make the town's inhabitants</li>
              <li>Cult will use looks to figure out who the player is (sometimes may kill someone who looks like the player for example)</li>
              <li>Note this game is VERY early in development and is only in the conceptual stages (may never even be made if I can't get assets figured out)</li>
            </ul>
